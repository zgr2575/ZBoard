Hello Roblox Developers!

This model is open source meaning you have all the code. 
I ask one thing. DO NOT SELL AS YOUR OWN
That is the one and only thing I ask. 

If you guys notice something or fix/add please make a pull request on GITHUB sharing thing for Credits in the script and have your
modules deprecated. 

We would love to see the posibilites of add-ons you Robloxians make. 

Thank you!
